                        اسكندرية‎ Eskendereyya; Coptic: ⲣⲁⲕⲟϯ Rakodī; Greek: Αλεξάνδρεια Alexándria) is the third-largest city in Egypt after Cairo and Giza, 
                        the seventh-largest city in Africa, and a major economic centre. With a total population of 5,381,000 , Alexandria is the 
                        largest city on the Mediterranean – also called the "Bride of the Mediterranean" by locals – the fourth-largest city in the Arab 
                        world and the ninth-largest urban area in Africa. The city extends about 40 km (25 mi) at the northern coast of Egypt along the 
                        Mediterranean Sea. Alexandria is a popular tourist destination, and also an important industrial centre because of its natural gas and oil pipelines from Suez.

                The Bibliotheca Alexandrina (Latin[1] for "Library of Alexandria"; Egyptian Arabic: مكتبة الإسكندرية‎ Maktabet al-Eskendereyya, 
                Egyptian Arabic: [mækˈtæb(e)t eskendeˈɾejjæ]) is a major library and cultural center on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea in 
                the Egyptian city of Alexandria. It is both a commemoration of the Library of Alexandria that was lost in antiquity, and an 
                attempt to rekindle something of the brilliance that this earlier center of study and erudition represented. The idea of reviving 
                the old library dates back to 1974, when a committee set up by Alexandria University selected a plot of land for its new library. 
                Construction work began in 1995 and, after some US$220 million had been spent, the complex was officially inaugurated on 16 October 
                2002. In 2010, the library received a donation of 500,000 books from the Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF). The gift makes the 
                Bibliotheca Alexandrina the sixth-largest Francophone library in the world.

                Montaza Palace (Arabic: قصر المنتزه‎) is a palace, museum and extensive gardens in the Montaza district of Alexandria, Egypt. It was
                built on a low plateau east of central Alexandria overlooking a beach on the Mediterranean Sea.
                The extensive Montaza Palace grounds first had the Salamlek Palace, built in 1892 by Khedive Abbas II, 
                the last Muhammad Ali Dynasty ruler to hold the Khedive title over the Khedivate of Egypt and Sudan. 
                It was used as a hunting lodge and residence for his companion.

                    The Corniche (Egyptian Arabic: الكرنيش‎, El Kornesh) is a waterfront promenade corniche in Alexandria, Egypt, 
                    running along the Eastern Harbour. It is one of the major corridors for traffic in Alexandria. The 
                    Corniche is formally designated "26 of July Road" west of Mansheya and "El Geish Road" east of it; 
                    however, these names are rarely used.
                    Italian-Egyptian architect Pietro Avoscani designed it in 1870.
                    The western end starts by the Citadel of Qaitbay (built in place of the Lighthouse of Alexandria). 
                    It runs for over ten miles and ends at Montaza.

                    Recent radiocarbon dating of seashell fragments and lead contamination show human activity at the location during 
                    the period of the Old Kingdom (27th–21st centuries BC) and again in the period 1000–800 BC, followed by the absence 
                    of activity thereafter. From ancient sources it is known there existed a trading post at this location during the 
                    time of Rameses the Great for trade with Crete, but it had long been lost by the time of Alexander's arrival. A small 
                    Egyptian fishing village named Rhakotis (Egyptian: rꜥ-qdy.t, 'That which is built up') existed since the 13th century 
                    BC in the vicinity and eventually grew into the Egyptian quarter of the city. Just east of Alexandria (where Abu Qir Bay is now), 
                    there was in ancient times marshland and several islands. As early as the 7th century BC, there existed important port cities of 
                    Canopus and Heracleion. The latter was recently rediscovered under water.
                    Alexander the Great
                    Alexandria was founded by Alexander the Great in April 331 BC as Ἀλεξάνδρεια (Alexandreia). Passing through Egypt, Alexander wanted 
                    to build a large Greek city on Egypt's coast that would bear his name. He chose the site of Alexandria, envisioning the building of a 
                    causeway to the nearby island of Pharos that would generate two great natural harbours.[9] Alexandria was intended to supersede the older 
                    Greek colony of Naucratis as a Hellenistic centre in Egypt, and to be the link between Greece and the rich Nile valley. A few months after 
                    the foundation, Alexander left Egypt and never returned to the city during his life.

                    In 619, Alexandria fell to the Sassanid Persians. Although the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius recovered it in 629, 
                    in 641 the Arabs under the general 'Amr ibn al-'As invaded it during the Muslim conquest of Egypt, after a siege 
                    that lasted 14 months. The first Arab governor of Egypt recorded to have visited Alexandria was Utba ibn Abi Sufyan, 
                    who strengthened the Arab presence and built a governor's palace in the city in 664–665.
                    After the Battle of Ridaniya in 1517, the city was conquered by the Ottoman Turks and remained under Ottoman rule until 1798. 
                    Alexandria lost much of its former importance to the Egyptian port city of Rosetta during the 9th to 18th centuries, and only 
                    regained its former prominence with the construction of the Mahmoudiyah Canal in 1807.
                    Alexandria figured prominently in the military operations of Napoleon's expedition to Egypt in 1798. French troops stormed the city on 
                    2 July 1798, and it remained in their hands until the arrival of a British expedition in 1801. The British won a considerable victory 
                    over the French at the Battle of Alexandria on 21 March 1801, following which they besieged the city, which fell to them on 2 September 
                    1801. Muhammad Ali, the Ottoman governor of Egypt, began rebuilding and redevelopment around 1810, and by 1850, Alexandria had returned to 
                    something akin to its former glory. Egypt turned to Europe in their effort to modernize the country. Greeks, followed by other Europeans 
                    and others, began moving to the city. In the early 20th century, the city became a home for novelists and poets.
