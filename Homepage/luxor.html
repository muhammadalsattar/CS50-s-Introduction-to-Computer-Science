                        [ˈloɡsˤor]; Sahidic Coptic: ⲡⲁⲡⲉ Pape, pronounced [ˈpapə]) is a city in Upper (southern) Egypt and the capital of 
                        Luxor Governorate. The population of Luxor is 127,994 (2020), with an area of approximately 417 square kilometres 
                        (161 sq mi). It is among the oldest inhabited cities in the world.
                        The modern city includes the site of the Ancient Egyptian city of Waset, also known as Nut (Coptic: ⲛⲏ) and to the 
                        Greeks as Thebes or Diospolis. Luxor has frequently been characterized as the "world's greatest open-air museum", as 
                        the ruins of the temple complexes at Karnak and Luxor stand within the modern city. Immediately opposite, across the River Nile, 
                        lie the monuments, temples and tombs of the west bank Necropolis, which includes the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens.
                        Thousands of tourists from all around the world arrive annually to visit these monuments, contributing greatly to the economy of the modern city.

                The Luxor Temple (Arabic: معبد الأقصر‎) is a large Ancient Egyptian temple complex located on the east bank of 
                the Nile River in the city today known as Luxor (ancient Thebes) and was constructed approximately 1400 BCE. 
                In the Egyptian language it is known as ipet resyt, "the southern sanctuary". In Luxor there are several great 
                temples on the east and west banks. Four of the major mortuary temples visited by early travelers include the 
                Temple of Seti I at Gurnah, the Temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el Bahri, the Temple of Ramesses II (i.e., Ramesseum), 
                and the Temple of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu. The two primary cults' temples on the east bank are known as the Karnak 
                and Luxor. Unlike the other temples in Thebes, Luxor temple is not dedicated to a cult god or a deified version of the 
                pharaoh in death.

                The Mosque of Abu Haggag (Arabic: مسجد أبو الحجاج بالأقصر) is a mosque in Luxor, Egypt. Specifically, it stands 
                atop the ruins of Luxor Temple, an Ancient Egyptian centre of worship dating back to the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep 
                III in the 14th century BC.
                The mosque stands on the ancient columns themselves. That part of the Luxor Temple was converted to a church by the 
                Copts in 395 AD, and then to a mosque in 640, more than 3400 years of continuous religious worship. Hence, the Luxor 
                Temple is the oldest building in the world at least partially active for other than archeological or tourist purposes.

                    The Ramesseum is the memorial temple (or mortuary temple) of Pharaoh Ramesses II ("Ramesses the Great", 
                    also spelled "Ramses" and "Rameses"). It is located in the Theban Necropolis in Upper Egypt, on the west 
                    of the River Nile, across from the modern city of Luxor. The name – or at least its French form Rhamesséion – 
                    was coined by Jean-François Champollion, who visited the ruins of the site in 1829 and first identified the 
                    hieroglyphs making up Ramesses's names and titles on the walls. It was originally called the House of millions of 
                    years of Usermaatra-setepenra that unites with Thebes-the-city in the domain of Amon. Usermaatra-setepenra was 
                    the prenomen of Ramesses II.

                    Luxor was the ancient city of Thebes, the great capital of Upper Egypt during the New Kingdom, 
                    and the glorious city of Amun, later to become the god Amun-Ra. The city was regarded in the 
                    ancient Egyptian texts as wAs.t (approximate pronunciation: "Waset"), which meant "city of the 
                    sceptre", and later in Demotic Egyptian as ta jpt (conventionally pronounced as "tA ipt" and meaning 
                    "the shrine/temple", referring to the jpt-swt, the temple now known by its Arabic name Karnak, 
                    meaning "fortified village"), which the ancient Greeks adapted as Thebai and the Romans after them 
                    as Thebae. Thebes was also known as "the city of the 100 gates", sometimes being called "southern 
                    Heliopolis" ('Iunu-shemaa' in Ancient Egyptian), to distinguish it from the city of Iunu or 
                    Heliopolis, the main place of worship for the god Ra in the north. It was also often referred to as 
                    niw.t, which simply means "city", and was one of only three cities in Egypt for which this noun was 
                    used (the other two were Memphis and Heliopolis); it was also called niw.t rst, "southern city", as 
                    the southernmost of them.

                    In April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the shrine of 
                    god Osiris- Ptah Neb, dating back to the 25th dynasty in the Temple of Karnak. According to 
                    archaeologist Essam Nagy, the material remains from the area contained clay pots, the lower 
                    part of a sitting statue and part of a stone panel showing an offering table filled with a sheep 
                    and a goose which were the symbols of the god Amun.
                    In November 2018, France's University of Strasbourg announced the discovery of two sarcophagi thought 
                    to be more than 3,500 years old with two perfectly preserved mummies and approximately 1,000 funerary 
                    statues in the Assasseef valley near Luxor. One of the tombs with paintings where the female body 
                    found, was opened to the public in front of the international media, but the other one was previously 
                    opened by Egyptian antiquities officials.
                    In October 2019, Egyptian archaeologists headed by Zahi Hawass revealed an ancient "industrial area" 
                    used to manufacture decorative artefacts, furniture and pottery for royal tombs. The site contained a 
                    big kiln to fire ceramics and 30 ateliers. According to Zahi Hawass, each atelier had a different aim 
                    – some of them were used to make pottery, others used to produce gold artefacts and others still to churn 
                    out furniture. About 75 meters below the valley, several items believed to have adorned wooden royal coffins, 
                    such as inlaid beads, silver rings and gold foil were unearthed. Some artefacts depicted the wings of deity 
                    Horus.
