                    Talaat Harb Street (Arabic: شارع طلعت حرب‎  pronounced [ˈtˤɑlʕɑt ˈħɑɾb]) is a historic street in downtown Cairo, Egypt, connecting Tahrir Square and Talaat Harb Square.
                    Originally it was named 'Soliman Pasha Street' after Suleiman Pasha, Egypt's French-born General under Muhammad Ali. The street was renamed in 1954 after Talaat Harb,
                    the leading Egyptian economist of the early 1900s. The street received the 'Talaat Harb Street' name during a sweeping effort by Egypt’s new president,
                    Gamal Abdel Nasser, to rid the city of all reminders of the Muhammad Ali dynasty and British occupation era.

                    The area around present-day Cairo, especially Memphis, which was the old capital of Egypt,
                    had long been a focal point of Ancient Egypt due to its strategic location just upstream 
                    from the Nile Delta. However, the origins of the modern city are generally traced back to
                    a series of settlements in the first millennium. Around the turn of the 4th century, as 
                    Memphis was continuing to decline in importance, the Romans established a fortress town 
                    along the east bank of the Nile. This fortress, known as Babylon, was the nucleus of the 
                    Roman and then the Byzantine city and is the oldest structure in the city today. It is also 
                    situated at the nucleus of the Coptic Orthodox community, which separated from the Roman and 
                    Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Many of Cairo's oldest Coptic churches, including 
                    the Hanging Church, are located along the fortress walls in a section of the city known as Coptic 
                    Cairo.

                    Until his death in 1848, Muhammad Ali Pasha instituted a number of social and economic 
                    reforms that earned him the title of founder of modern Egypt. However, while 
                    Muhammad Ali initiated the construction of public buildings in the city, those reforms 
                    had minimal effect on Cairo's landscape. Bigger changes came to Cairo under Isma'il Pasha 
                    (r. 1863–1879), who continued the modernisation processes started by his grandfather. 
                    Drawing inspiration from Paris, Isma'il envisioned a city of maidans and wide avenues; 
                    due to financial constraints, only some of them, in the area now composing Downtown Cairo, 
                    came to fruition.[58] Isma'il also sought to modernize the city, which was merging with 
                    neighbouring settlements, by establishing a public works ministry, bringing gas and lighting 
                    to the city, and opening a theatre and opera house.
